# Background
## Overview
- 4 October, Hurricane Matthew struck Haiti 
    - resulted in largest *humanitarian* emergency since 2010 earthquake
        - ~ 1.4m people in need of humanitarian assistance
        - extensive flooding & mudslides
        - damage to road infrastructure & buildings
        - electricity and water shortages
- 546 confirmed deaths, 128 missing, 438 injured
- 65 HF affected

# Epidemiology
## Acute watery diarrhoea epicurve by day
- ~ 8000 AWD cases

```{r}
DisplayResult('epicurve_by_day_all')
```


## AWD attack rates by commune
```{r}
v1 <- grid::viewport(width = 1, height = 1, x = 0.5, y = 0.5) # plot area for the main map
v2 <- grid::viewport(width = 0.3, height = 0.2, x = 0.65, y = 0.68) # plot area for the inset map
DisplayResult('map_main') %>% print(vp = v1)
DisplayResult('map_inset') %>% print(vp = v2)
```

# Activities
## Coordination
Co-chairing the weekly surveillance and lab meetings

## Coordination

## Vaccination campaign
- 8-18 November
- 736,421 out of 817,000 targeted (~90%)

## Field investigations
- Alerts of clusters of community cases & deaths
- Reports of institutional deaths
- Routine assessments of CTCs
- Useful for various reasons:
    - early-detection and response to alerts
    - collecting & comparing data in registers w/ what is reported
    - community contact (aquatabs, PH messaging, etc)
    - strengthening relationship b/n PAHO and MSPP
    – MSPP rely on partner vehicles

## Data management, analysis & reporting
- Existing system not fit for purpose
    - 2x daily data collection
    - excel as database
        - 8 new columns per day since Jan 2012
        - \>14,500 columns!
        - very heavy: ~40MB, takes several minutes to open
    - burden of reporting imposes aggregation
    - data analysis in excel
    - PAHO epi working until midnight every night to enter data and generate reports

# Recommendations
## Investigations
- Continue to support MSPP in field epidemiological investigations, but under more clearly defined SOPs.

## Data management, analysis & reporting
- Continue to support weekly surveillance activities through data compilation, analysis, reporting and coordination.
- Immediate term 
    - dramatically reduce daily burden on epi staff through minimised data collection process & automated data analysis & reporting

# Demonstration of automated analysis & reporting system

## Data management, analysis & reporting cont'd
- Weaknesses in surv. system investigated & documented
    - analyses demonstrating timeliness & completeness of reporting
    - capture-recapture studies to estimate sensitivity at 2 levels:
        - from **community** level to the **facility/CTC** level (i.e. what % of suspected cases are not detected by the surveillance system)
        - from **facility/CTC** level to the **departmental/central** level (i.e. do the data reported by the facilities accurately reflect what has been observed)
- Longer term - transform cholera surveillance system
    - (active) community-based
    - individual level information
        - i.e. line list to capture essential variables for analysis
    - streamlined data entry, compilation, analysis & reporting (**EWARS**)

## Broader epidemiological profile
- Not only focus on cholera response post Hurricane Matthew
    - impact on primary health care service delivery (e.g. Basic Emergency Obstetric Care)?
    - malaria surveillance (areas of greatest malaria incidence in Haiti)
        - what has been impact on malaria incidence & access to treatment?
    - bloody diarrhoea; diptheria
    - food security/malnutrition surveillance
        - large % of crops & livestock destroyed
        - serious impact on food security and acute malnutrition should be anticipated
        - establish community-based malnutrition surveillance to early-detect deteriorations in nutritional status
